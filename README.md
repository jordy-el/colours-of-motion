> Make a panorama of colours used in a Movie

This ruby script takes a movie file as an
input, processes the frames, and turns the
average colour of each into a stripe on a
panorama.

Output file is placed in same folder as input
and has the same name with '.jpg' appended.

To install, run `bundle install` inside the
project folder.

Example: `ruby app.rb ~/Desktop/Paper_Towns.mkv`
